				<center><b>about the service</b><br></center>
				this service was created by christian schäl, a german it student. this projects main motivation
				originates from watching a multiplayer game recorded by different players from different viewpoints
				as a single video. instead of viewing the video in 4 different windows next to each other and
				struggling with correct timing, performance and synced playback, you simply submit videos and stream
				the combined output on any device.
